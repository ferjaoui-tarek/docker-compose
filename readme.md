# Docker compose
Is a tool for defining & running multi-container docker applications
we use yaml files to configure application services ```docker-compose.yml```
You can start all services with a single command 
```
# docker compose up
```

You can stop all services with a single command 
```
# docker compose down
```
You can scale up selected services when required


Step 1 : install docker compose (already installed on windows and mac with docker)
```
# docker-compose -v
```
